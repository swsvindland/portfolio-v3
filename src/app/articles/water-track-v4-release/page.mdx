I just released the fourth major version of my most popular mobile app WaterTrack. This update includes only a small number of changes but they are hopefully very useful to our users.

## Drink Size Slider

## Material Design Version 3

See the [official docs](https://m3.material.io/) for what material v3 encompasses but I mainly focused on the parts like adaptive color and the navigation components.

## Updated to Flutter 3.19
  - This update from the Flutter team fixed a number of issues with some material components behaving differently than their native counter parts.
  - I upgraded from a version that did not use Impeller on IOS so this version got those performance benefits and I am already seeing less stuttering on certain animations.
